# Wacatac.exe
This is a terribly written example piece of RANSOMEWARE written in python.  I have uploaded this so I can share another way attackers may try to get around AVs.

It was written in python but I designed it to be turned into a .exe file.  This file only gets determined to be a virus if it is asking for admin rights.

I have kept it on my pc and put it through VirusTotal 4 days ago, it gets a 15/72.

In its current state I have made it so the decrypter that get's downloaded will prevent signifigant damage on anyone that decides to run the software.

It won't destroy your computer, but it could potentially encrypt every file under a users control.

I won't upload until I'm ready, not yet.
